<h3> Man Not Accepting Any More Television Recommendations At This Time</h3>

<img class="article_pic" src="images/article_pic.jpg">

<p class="paragraph"> CINCINNATI—Issuing the proclamation directly to friends and family Wednesday afternoon, local man Sean Patterson officially announced he is no longer accepting television series recommendations at this time. “While I am grateful for all of the input I have received in recent weeks, I must regretfully inform you that the window for offering new televised programming suggestions for me to watch has officially closed,” said the 43-year-old, adding that, as of noon today, no further titles of network, cable, or online streaming shows would be considered for potential viewing, no matter how star-studded or critically acclaimed. “I might seek input regarding new televised content to watch in the future, at which point I will make a public announcement alerting all concerned parties of my intention to find a new show to watch, and I will urge you all to resubmit your recommendations for any police procedurals, comedies, and true crime miniseries you think I’ll enjoy. However, until that time, I will be unable to process any further television consumption proposals. Thank you for your understanding on this matter.” At press time, Patterson had temporarily lifted his TV recommendation moratorium after abandoning his sister Lynn’s suggestion of Designated Survivor one and a half episodes in.</p>
